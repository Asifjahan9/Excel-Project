Y-axis (right): Total Orders
This will clearly show trends and correlations between sales and order volumes and identified the month with the hightest sales and orders.


2. Gender-based Purchases in 2022

Uses a pie chart to represent the percentage of sales by men and women.
Include absolute numbers to add clarity.

3. Order Status Distribution in 2022

Create a stacked bar pie chart showing the proportion of:
Delivered
Refunded
Returned
Cancelled
This visualization helps in understanding the operational efficiency.

4. Top 5 States Contributing to Sales

Use a horizontal bar chart listing the top 5 states by sales volume, sorted in descending order.
Add sales figures as data labels for quick reference.
